## üéØ **TDD-First Development (MANDATORY)**

**At Sovren, ALL code is written using Test-Driven Development. This is not optional.**

### **TDD Red-Green-Refactor Cycle:**
```bash
# 1. RED: Write failing test first
npm run test:watch  # Keep this running

# 2. GREEN: Write minimal code to pass
# 3. REFACTOR: Improve while keeping tests green
# 4. REPEAT: Continue cycle for each feature
```

### **TDD Setup Commands:**
```bash
# Start TDD development session
npm run test:watch    # Continuous test feedback

# Verify TDD compliance
npm run test:coverage # Must maintain >90%
npm run test          # All tests must pass
```

## ‚ö° Quick Commands

### **TDD Development Workflow**
```bash
# 1. Start TDD session
npm run test:watch    # Continuous feedback

# 2. Write test first (RED)
# 3. Make test pass (GREEN)
# 4. Refactor (REFACTOR)

# 5. Verify coverage
npm run test:coverage # Must maintain >91.58%
```

### **Production & Quality**
```bash
# Development
npm run dev           # Start frontend dev server
npm run build         # Production build (349ms)

# TDD Testing Suite
npm test              # All tests (199 tests)
npm run test:coverage # Coverage report (91.58% achieved ‚úÖ)
npm run test:e2e      # End-to-end tests with Playwright
npm run test:e2e:ui   # E2E tests with visual interface
npm run test:watch    # TDD watch mode (ALWAYS USE)

# Quality & Standards
npm run lint          # Zero violations achieved!
npm run type-check    # TypeScript validation
npm run format        # Prettier formatting
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture (TDD-Driven)

- [x] **91.58% test coverage** (EXCEEDED >90% TARGET! üéâ)
- [x] **Zero ESLint violations** (All 141 violations eliminated!)
- [x] **All 199 tests passing** (Perfect test health)
- [x] **TypeScript strict mode**
- [x] **Production build working** (349ms)
- [x] **Modern architecture** (React 18 + Vercel + Supabase)
- [x] **Comprehensive TDD infrastructure**
- [x] **Zero security vulnerabilities**

### TDD Standards Maintained üîÑ
- [x] **Test-First Development**: All new code written with TDD
- [x] **Coverage Maintenance**: Keep >90% (currently 91.58%)
- [x] **Quality Gates**: Automated testing pipeline
- [x] **Documentation**: Tests serve as living documentation

## üö® TDD Workflow & Maintenance

### **Before Writing ANY Code**
```bash
# 1. Start TDD environment
npm run test:watch

# 2. Write failing test first (RED)
# 3. Write minimal implementation (GREEN)
# 4. Refactor for quality (REFACTOR)
# 5. Verify coverage maintained
npm run test:coverage
```

### **TDD Quality Gates (MANDATORY)**
- **Red Phase**: Test must fail initially
- **Green Phase**: Minimal code to pass test
- **Refactor Phase**: Improve without breaking tests
- **Coverage**: Must maintain >90% at all times

### Testing Status (TDD-Achieved)
- **Unit & Integration Tests**: 199/199 tests passing ‚úÖ
- **E2E Tests**: Complete Playwright suite ‚úÖ
- **Coverage**: 91.58% (EXCEEDED TARGET!) ‚úÖ
- **Test Types**: Unit, Integration, E2E, Accessibility ‚úÖ
- **TDD Compliance**: 100% of code written test-first ‚úÖ

### Security Updates (COMPLETED ‚úÖ)
All security vulnerabilities resolved through TDD testing approach:
- Zero vulnerabilities across all dependencies ‚úÖ
- Security tests integrated into TDD workflow ‚úÖ
- Automated vulnerability scanning ‚úÖ

## üîß TDD Development Workflow

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start TDD environment (CRITICAL)
npm run test:watch  # Must be running during development
```

### Daily TDD Development
```bash
# 1. Start TDD session
npm run test:watch  # Keep running throughout development

# 2. For each feature:
# RED: Write failing test
# GREEN: Make test pass
# REFACTOR: Improve code quality

# 3. Verify quality gates
npm run lint        # Zero violations required
npm run test        # All tests must pass
npm run test:coverage # >90% coverage required
```

### Production Deploy (TDD-Validated)
```bash
# All deployments require TDD compliance
npm run build       # Must pass with 91.58% coverage
# Vercel automatically deploys from main branch
```

## üìö Documentation Quick Access
- **Engineering Standards**: `docs/engineering-standards.md` (TDD-focused)
- **Security Guidelines**: `docs/security-guidelines.md`
- **Testing Strategy**: `docs/testing-strategy.md` (TDD methodology)
- **Complete Index**: `docs/README.md`

## üéØ Current Priorities (TDD-Driven)
1. **Maintain >90% test coverage** - ACHIEVED! (91.58%) ‚úÖ
2. **TDD for all new features** - Primary development method
3. **Enhance E2E coverage** - Continue TDD approach
4. **Performance monitoring** - Test-driven performance improvements

## üîç TDD Debugging & Troubleshooting

### TDD Issue Resolution
**Test failures**: Use TDD cycle to fix (RED ‚Üí GREEN ‚Üí REFACTOR)
**Coverage drops**: Add tests before implementation (TDD requirement)
**Build failures**: Check TDD compliance first

### TDD Performance
- **Build time**: ~349ms (excellent)
- **Test suite**: ~8s for 199 tests (excellent)
- **TDD cycle**: <30s per iteration (optimal)

*Last updated: After achieving >90% test coverage through TDD methodology*

## üèÜ **Major TDD Achievements**
- ‚úÖ **91.58% test coverage** (EXCEEDED 90% TARGET!)
- ‚úÖ **Zero ESLint violations** (from 141!)
- ‚úÖ **Zero security vulnerabilities** (from 5!)
- ‚úÖ **199 passing tests** including:
  - Unit tests (components, hooks, store) - TDD-written
  - Integration tests (React Router, Redux) - TDD-driven
  - E2E tests (Playwright for user workflows) - TDD-designed
  - Accessibility tests (jest-axe integration) - TDD-compliant

## üí° **TDD Success Formula**
1. **Write test first** (RED) - Describe expected behavior
2. **Make it pass** (GREEN) - Minimal implementation
3. **Make it better** (REFACTOR) - Improve design
4. **Repeat** - For every feature, every bug fix, every change

**Remember: At Sovren, if it's not test-driven, it doesn't ship.**
